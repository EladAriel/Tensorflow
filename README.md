# Tensorflow - Deep Learning Project

In this page you'll find personal Deep Learning projects.
Each project is made using the skills I've acquired from 'TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2022: Zero to Mastery' course.

## General Projects
| Number | Project Name | Description |
| ----- |  ----- |  ----- |
