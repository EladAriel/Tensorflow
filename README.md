# Tensorflow Project
In this page you'll find personal Deep Learning projects.
Each project is made using the skills I've acquired from 'TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2022: Zero to Mastery' course.

The projects are as follows:
1. *Mechanical Properties of Low Alloy Steels - Regression*: The purpose of the project is to predict the mechanical properties using the alloy composition and temperature.
