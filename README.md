# Tensorflow Project

In this page you'll find personal Deep Learning projects.
Each project is made using the skills I've acquired from 'TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2022: Zero to Mastery' course.

## Deep Learning Projects

| Number | Project Name | Description |
| ----- |  ----- |  ----- |
| 00 | [Mechanical Properties of Low Alloy Steels - Regression](https://github.com/EladAriel/Tensorflow/blob/main/Mechanical_Properties_of_Low_Alloy_Steels_Regression.ipynb) | The purpose of the project is to predict the mechanical properties using the alloy composition and temperature. |
| 01 | [MNIST Classification](https://github.com/EladAriel/Tensorflow/blob/main/MNIST_Classification.ipynb) | The purpose of the project is to figure out the relationship between the images pixel values and their labels. |

The projects are as follows:
1. *Mechanical Properties of Low Alloy Steels - Regression*: The purpose of the project is to predict the mechanical properties using the alloy composition and temperature.
2. *MNIST Classification*: The purpose of the project is to figure out the relationship between the images pixel values and their labels.
3. *uc_merced CNN Computer Vision*: The purpose of the project is to detect pattern in visual data using Convolutional Neural Networks.
